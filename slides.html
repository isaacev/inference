# Template structure inference

Can we build a form using only a Mustacle-like HTML template?

---

# Existing template libraires

- Popular libraries include Mustache, Handlebars, and Dust
- Minimal syntax, use `{{` and `}}` to identify template commands
- But type enforcement is too weak to make inference useful
  - These libraries often use JavaScript's falsy logic

In this Handlebars example:
```handlebars
{{#if things}}
  {{ things }}
{{/if}}
```

Setting the **`things`** variable to any of these values skips the `if` body
- empty string
- empty array
- `false`
- `null`

This makes it hard to determine what the type of **`things`** should be

---

# New template syntax

- Chunks of plaintext with tags wrapped in double-braces
- Blocks open with hash-symbol, closed with forward slash
- Variable references begin with dot, can be chained together
- Stronger type system to make infering types easier

An example template:
```handlebars
<p>hello, {{.name}}</p>
<ul>
{{#loop .friends}}
  <li>friends with {{.name}}</li>
{{/loop}}
</ul>
```

Which can output the HTML:

```html
<p>hello, Alice</p>
<ul>
  <li>friends with Bob</li>
  <li>friends with Carol</li>
</ul>
```

---

# Type inference: Strings

- All printed variables are inferred as having the **`String`** type

For example:
```handlebars
hello {{.firstName}} {{.lastName}}
```

Infers the following document structure:
```typescript
{
  "firstName": string
  "lastName": string
}
```

---

# Type inference: Lists

- The built-in `{{#loop}}` block infers that its reference is a list
- Initially, the list member type is unknown but as the block body is evaluated, that type is refined

For example:
```handlebars
{{#loop .things}}
  <p><strong>{{.name}}</strong> {{.desc}}</p>
{{/loop}}
```

Infers the following document structure:
```typescript
{
  "things": [
    {
      name: string
      desc: string
    }
  ]
}
```

---

# Type inference: Lists (cont)

- References do not have to always refer to a named member
- A single dot is used to reference the current scope and any inferences will be applied to the current scope

For example:
```handlebars
<ul>
{{#loop .}}
  <li>{{.}}</li>
{{/loop}}
</ul>
```

Infers the following structure:
```typescript
[string]
```

---

# Limitations so far

- By using only String and List types, the final document is limited in how adaptable it can be
- There still needs to be a way to express that a document could have one of a few different structures

---

# Type inference: Match

- The `{{#match}}` block allows different structures to be described in parallel
- This enables the inference of the `Or` type
- Each `{{#match}}` block can have 0 or more `{{:or}}` clauses

For example:
```handlebars
{{#match .thing}}
  {{.}}
{{:or}}
  {{#loop .thing}}
    {{.name}}
  {{/loop}}
{{/match}}
```

Infers the following structure:
```typescript
{
  "thing": string | [{ "name": string }]
}
```

---

# Type inference: Match (cont)

```handlebars
<h1>{{.title}}</h1>

{{#match .article}}
  <article>{{.text}}</article>

{{:or}}
  <h2>Links:</h2>
  <ul>
  {{#loop .links}}
    <a src="{{.href}}">{{.text}}</a>
  {{/loop}}
  </ul>

{{:or}}
  <h2>Gallery:</h2>
  <ul>
  {{#loop .images}}
    <img src="{{.src}}" alt="{{.alt}}" />
  {{/loop}}
  </ul>

{{/match}}
```
